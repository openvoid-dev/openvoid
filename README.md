***At Open Void, we strive not to create mediocre products -- products with half-hearted efforts and "good enough" solutions.*** 

***We are tired of seeing bloated software filled with small, soul-sucking bugs that exist just because they can be fixed later, instead of creating something worthwhile, something that inspires people.***

***By rejecting mediocrity, we demand more from ourselves and refuse to settle for anything short of perfection.***

***Open: We are here to embrace opennes of software and solutions.***

***Void: The void represents a place of boundless potential. To not limit yourself by predefined thoughts and self-doubt, but to create something you are proud of.***
