In the last couple of years, we have seen a boom in new AI solutions, from LLMs to AI programmers and even AI code editors like [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh). And they are all great products and solutions, but where do we draw a line on the code we write with them?

At Open Void, we believe that although these solutions are making us more productive, we should not rely on them as heavily as some people do, where half of our codebase is written by an LLM. The code we write and ship should be written by us, but with the help of AI we can edit our code, use it to help us see maybe a better solution.

Because if ChatGPT writes our code, is that code really ours, did we actually try to come to the solution ourselves or just let ChatGPT to fix it for us?

We should take pride in writing code ourselves, but with the help of AI we can edit that code, handle redundant tasks, and increase our productivity.
