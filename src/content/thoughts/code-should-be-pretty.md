_For us, writing code shouldn't just be about making something work, something that looks great and shiny from the outside but is rotten from the inside with unmaintainable and unreadable code. If you can't write something in a pretty manner you shouldn't write it at all._

_We strongly believe in writing beautiful code above all else there is. We are working as programmers not because of the money, and don't look at it as just our day job, a means to an end._

_We are programmers because we value and love the process of writing something beautiful, something that although may never be seen by anyone else but ourselves should still be written as beautifully as it can be, because that is what brings us joy._

_Write code that inspires you, that when you look at it, you are truly proud of it._

_Even if it is seen only by you, it means the world to you._
